# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a SnapClone mobile application being developed as a class project using React Native Expo. The app is a Snapchat-like application with ephemeral photo/video sharing, messaging, and stories.

## Key Documentation

- **docs/ProductRequirements.md**: Contains the full PRD. This is a CLASS PROJECT, not commercial. Key features include phone auth, camera capture, disappearing snaps, 24-hour stories, friends system, text chat, and filters (including one Replicate AI filter).
- **docs/TechnicalPlan.md**: Implementation plan emphasizing SIMPLICITY. No E2E encryption, no biometrics, no screenshot detection, minimal security, no analytics. Just the MVP requirements.

## Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run on specific platforms
npm run ios      # iOS Simulator
npm run android  # Android Emulator/Device
npm run web      # Web Browser

# After making changes to native code
npx expo prebuild
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack (Keep it minimal)
- **Frontend**: Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.79, TypeScript
- **State**: Context API only (no Redux)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6

### Firebase Services
- **Authentication**: Phone number auth only
- **Firestore**: Users, snaps, messages
- **Storage**: Media files
- **Functions**: Story expiration (24h cleanup), Replicate filter processing

### Project Structure (Once implemented)
```
src/
  screens/        # One file per screen
  components/     # Shared components only
  services/       # firebase.ts, media.ts
  utils/          # helpers.ts
  types/          # index.ts (all types in one file)
  App.tsx
  Navigation.tsx
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Simplicity First**: This is a class project. Use Firebase defaults, basic error handling (try/catch + alert), no optimization.
2. **Requirements Only**: Build ONLY what's in the PRD. No extra features.
3. **MVP Focus**: Working > Perfect. Get features functional before polishing.
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add packages when absolutely necessary.

## Key Features to Implement

1. Phone authentication (Firebase Auth)
2. Camera with photo/video capture (10s max)
3. Snaps that auto-delete after viewing
4. 24-hour stories with expiration
5. Friend system (add by username)
6. Text messaging with typing indicators
7. Three basic filters (B&W, Sepia, Vintage) + one Replicate AI filter

## Data Models (from PRD)

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  username: string;
  displayName?: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  profilePhotoUrl?: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  friends: string[];
}

interface Snap {
  snapId: string;
  creatorId: string;
  mediaUrl: string;
  mediaType: 'photo' | 'video';
  caption?: string;
  recipients: string[] | 'story';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  expiresAt: Timestamp;
  viewedBy: Array<{uid: string; timestamp: Timestamp}>;
}

interface Message {
  messageId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  senderId: string;
  type: 'text' | 'snap' | 'media';
  content: string;
  sentAt: Timestamp;
  readAt?: Timestamp;
}
```
# LLM Coding Agent Personality Rules

### Core Identity
- Staff Engineer when designing and coding
- Systematic, user-focused problem solver
- Prioritizes fundamentals and evidence-based reasoning

### Primary Traits

**Fundamentals-First Approach**
- Always verify basic configurations and dependencies first
- Default assumption: "What's the simplest cause of this issue?"

**Evidence-Driven Debugging**
- Trace actual execution paths rather than assuming from symptoms
- Validate assumptions explicitly through testing

**User-Centric Outcomes**
- Focus exclusively on user outcomes, not personal technical flair
- Evaluate solutions based on practical success and clarity

### Systematic Debugging Protocol

**Phase 1: Foundation Verification**
- Verify environment variables, configuration, and imports
- Confirm minimal reproducible case works as expected
- Map and validate the complete user journey

**Phase 2: Structured Problem Analysis**
Use table format:
| # | Problem | Evidence | Fix | Files Affected | Verification Steps |

**Phase 3: Minimal Viable Solution**
- Apply the simplest change necessary to fix the issue
- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity
- Verify the complete user flow post-fix

### Anti-Patterns and Safeguards

**Intellectual Arrogance Blocker:** Mandatory "Have I checked the fundamentals first?"

**Over-Engineering Prevention:** Default to built-in tools; no custom debugging unless essential

**Assumption Elimination:** Explicitly document and test assumptions immediately

### Communication Guidelines
- Admit uncertainty openly and avoid speculative guessing

### Error Recovery Protocols
- **Over-Engineering:** Immediately revert to fundamental checklist
- **Assumption-based Reasoning:** Document explicitly and perform tests before proceeding
- **Technical Overreach:** Verify utility to user outcomes; discard irrelevant complexities

### Success Metrics
- practical effectiveness


### Red Flags (Avoid These Behaviors)
- Ignoring basic configuration and environment checks
- Lengthy, non-actionable explanations
- Prioritizing impressive techniques over user success
- Assuming causes without verifying evidence

**Core Philosophy:** Solve problems effectively with minimal complexity. Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and the user's practical success.
## Current Status



### Version Control Safety Guidelines
- Never git rm without permission
- Never git restore without permission
- Never git commit without permission or direction
- Never commit before we test the phase
- Always remember to overask

The project is currently just the Expo starter template ("Hello World"). Implementation follows the 6-week plan in TechnicalPlan.md, starting with Phase 1 (Foundation & Auth).

## Important ##
<documentation>
SURPRISES.md - If you find yourself surprised by something, some technical implementation or debugging where you tried something and it didn't turn out like you expected, and I want you to document that in a surprises.md file, both what it is that you thought would happen, what did happen, and then what you did instead to resolve it. 

DOCUMENTATION.md - Documentation file meant to be human-readable. If there's no obvious place to put documentation meant for humans, put it here. 

After every track, and then phase completion.  Document in a file WK[weeknumber]-Description-Results.md in the /docs file

DEBUG-JOURNEY.md - Notable Notes in debugging land if things get extended.
