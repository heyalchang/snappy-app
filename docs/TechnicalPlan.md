# SnapClone Technical Implementation Plan - MVP

## Core Principles
- **Simplest path to MVP** - This is a class project, not commercial

## Technical Decisions (Simplified)

### Stack
```
Frontend:
- Expo SDK (latest stable)
- TypeScript (basic config)
- React Navigation 6
- Context API only

Backend:
- Firebase Auth (phone)
- Firestore (basic rules)
- Firebase Storage
- Cloud Functions (minimal)

External:
- Replicate API (one filter)
```

### Project Structure
```
src/
  screens/        # One file per screen
  components/     # Shared UI components
  services/       # firebase.ts, media.ts
  utils/          # helpers.ts
  types/          # index.ts
  App.tsx
  Navigation.tsx
```

### Data Models
- User: `uid, username, displayName, phoneNumber, friends[]`
- Snap: `snapId, creatorId, mediaUrl, recipients, expiresAt, viewedBy[]`
- Message: `messageId, senderId, content, sentAt, readAt`

---

## What We're NOT Building
- CI/CD pipelines
- Multiple environments
- E2E encryption
- Screenshot detection
- Analytics tracking
- Error monitoring (beyond console.log)
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility features
- COPPA/GDPR compliance
- 99.9% uptime requirements

---

## Definition of Done (Class Project Version)

âœ… **Feature Complete**: All PRD requirements implemented  
âœ… **No Crashes**: App doesn't crash during normal use  
âœ… **Works on Simulator**: iOS and Android simulators both work  
âœ… **Demo Ready**: Can demonstrate all features in class

## Risk Mitigations (Simple)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Firebase quotas | Use sparingly during testing |
| Video too large | Limit to 10 seconds, compress |
| Replicate API fails | Show error, use basic filters |
| Time running out | Focus on core loop first |

---

## Notes

This is a simplified MVP for a class project. Security is basic (HTTPS + Firebase Auth), performance is not optimized, and we're only building exactly what's in the requirements document.
