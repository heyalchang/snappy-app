# Week 1: Foundation & Auth - Results

## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup ✅
- Initialized git repository and synced with GitHub
- Reorganized project structure (moved app files to root)
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation
- Fixed Expo configuration warnings

### TypeScript Migration ✅
- Converted project to TypeScript
- Created tsconfig.json with strict settings
- Set up proper types for React Native

### Core Dependencies ✅
- Installed React Navigation (`@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/native-stack`)
- Installed Firebase SDK
- Installed supporting libraries (react-native-screens, react-native-safe-area-context)

### Project Structure ✅
Created organized folder structure:
```
src/
  screens/      # Authentication screens
  components/   # (Ready for shared components)
  services/     # Firebase and auth services
  utils/        # (Ready for helpers)
  types/        # TypeScript interfaces
  App.tsx       # Main app component
  Navigation.tsx # Navigation setup
```

### Navigation Setup ✅
- Implemented stack navigation with proper TypeScript types
- Created navigation flow for auth and main app screens
- Set up conditional navigation based on auth state

### Authentication Screens ✅
Created all authentication screens with proper styling:
1. **AuthScreen** - Landing page with login/signup buttons
2. **PhoneNumberScreen** - Phone number input with formatting
3. **VerifyCodeScreen** - 6-digit code verification with auto-focus
4. **UsernameScreen** - Profile creation (username & display name)

### Firebase Configuration ✅
- Set up Firebase initialization
- Created auth service with phone authentication methods
- Implemented mock authentication flow (ready for real Firebase integration)

## Technical Decisions

1. **Firebase Web SDK**: Using Firebase's web SDK with Expo (not ejecting)
2. **Context API**: Planning to use Context API for state management (no Redux)
3. **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for better type safety
4. **Mock Auth**: Implemented mock auth flow for testing, ready for real Firebase integration

## Next Steps (Week 2)

1. Set up real Firebase project and add configuration
2. Implement actual phone authentication with Firebase
3. Add user profile creation in Firestore
4. Begin camera implementation
5. Create basic UI components library

## Known Issues

1. Firebase phone auth will need expo-firebase-recaptcha for production
2. Need to handle auth persistence
3. Need to implement proper error handling for network failures

## Testing Notes

- All screens render correctly
- Navigation flow works as expected
- Form validation implemented
- Loading states added for async operations
