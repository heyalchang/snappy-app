# Week 2: Camera & Media Capture - Completion Report

**Date**: June 23, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Linear Issue**: POT-11

## Completed Tasks

### Track 1: Camera Implementation ✅
- Installed expo-camera package
- Created CameraScreen component with full functionality
- Implemented tap for photo capture
- Implemented hold for video recording (10s max limit)
- Added front/back camera toggle button
- Added flash on/off toggle
- Added camera permissions handling

### Track 2: Media Preview ✅
- Created MediaPreviewScreen component
- Full-screen display of captured photos/videos
- Video playback with auto-loop
- Retake button to go back to camera
- Caption text input with 100 character limit
- Save to device gallery functionality
- Loading state for save operation

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **CameraScreen.tsx**
   - Uses expo-camera for camera functionality
   - Gesture handling for tap (photo) vs hold (video)
   - Recording indicator for video mode
   - Clean UI with translucent controls

2. **MediaPreviewScreen.tsx**
   - Uses expo-av for video playback
   - Uses expo-media-library for saving to gallery
   - Keyboard-aware layout for caption input
   - Consistent UI with Snapchat-style design

### Navigation Updates
- Imported both new screens
- Temporarily set `isAuthenticated = true` for testing
- Connected SnapPreview route to MediaPreviewScreen

### Dependencies Added
- `expo-camera@~16.1.8` - Camera functionality
- `expo-media-library@~17.1.7` - Save to gallery
- `expo-av@~15.1.6` - Video playback

## User Flow

1. App opens directly to camera (auth bypassed for testing)
2. User can:
   - Tap shutter button for photo
   - Hold shutter button for video (up to 10s)
   - Toggle front/back camera
   - Toggle flash on/off
3. After capture, preview screen shows:
   - Full-screen media display
   - Option to add caption
   - Save to gallery button
   - Retake button
   - Send button (placeholder for Week 3)

## Testing Notes

- Camera permissions properly requested
- Gallery save permissions properly requested
- Video recording stops at 10 seconds
- All UI controls responsive
- Navigation flow smooth

## Known Limitations

1. Send functionality shows "Coming Soon" alert (Week 3)
2. Friends/Stories buttons lead to placeholder screens
3. No filters implemented yet (Week 6)
4. Auth is bypassed for testing

## Next Steps (Week 3)

1. Implement Firebase Storage upload
2. Create snap metadata in Firestore
3. Add loading states during upload
4. Implement snap lifecycle (view & delete)
5. Add 24-hour story expiration

## Bug Resolution

### POT-16: Video Recording Hang
**Problem**: `recordAsync()` promise never resolved due to:
1. New Architecture incompatibility with expo-camera's legacy event system
2. React state update race condition with mode switching

**Solution Applied (Workaround)**:
1. Set `newArchEnabled: false` in app.json (addresses event bridge issue)
2. **Hard-coded `<CameraView mode="video" />`** (final fix that made it work)
3. Added timeout mechanism as safety net

**Result**: Video recording now works perfectly, completing in ~1s after button release

**Important Note**: This is a workaround, not a proper fix. The hard-coded video mode eliminates the race condition but introduces a slight photo shutter lag (~30-40ms). We expect SDK 54 with expo-camera 17 to provide proper Fabric support, allowing us to re-enable New Architecture and implement proper mode switching.

## Exit Criteria Met ✅

### Camera Implementation
- [x] Camera opens when app launches (via tab navigation)
- [x] Can capture photos
- [x] Can record videos up to 10 seconds
- [x] Camera controls work

### Media Preview
- [x] Preview shows after capture
- [x] Can add caption text
- [x] Can save to device gallery
- [x] Can retake photo/video

## Code Quality

- TypeScript types properly defined
- Consistent styling approach
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Clean component structure
- Reusable patterns established

## Linear Status Update

All Linear issues have been updated to align with Technical Plan:
- Week 1: Foundation & Auth ✅ (POT-10)
- Week 2: Camera & Media Capture ✅ (POT-11) 
- Week 3: Snap Storage & Viewing (POT-17)
- Week 4: Social Features & Messaging (POT-12)
- Week 5: Offline Support & Polish (POT-13)
- Week 6: Filters & Final MVP (POT-15)
