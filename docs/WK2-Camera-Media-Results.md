## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **CameraScreen.tsx**
   - Uses expo-camera for camera functionality
   - Gesture handling for tap (photo) vs hold (video)
   - Recording indicator for video mode
   - Clean UI with translucent controls

2. **MediaPreviewScreen.tsx**
   - Uses expo-av for video playback
   - Uses expo-media-library for saving to gallery
   - Keyboard-aware layout for caption input
   - Consistent UI with Snapchat-style design

### Navigation Updates
- Imported both new screens
- Temporarily set `isAuthenticated = true` for testing
- Connected SnapPreview route to MediaPreviewScreen

### Dependencies Added
- `expo-camera@~16.1.8` - Camera functionality
- `expo-media-library@~17.1.7` - Save to gallery
- `expo-av@~15.1.6` - Video playback

## User Flow

1. App opens directly to camera (auth bypassed for testing)
2. User can:
   - Tap shutter button for photo
   - Hold shutter button for video (up to 10s)
   - Toggle front/back camera
   - Toggle flash on/off
3. After capture, preview screen shows:
   - Full-screen media display
   - Option to add caption
   - Save to gallery button
   - Retake button
   - Send button (placeholder for Week 3)

## Testing Notes

- Camera permissions properly requested
- Gallery save permissions properly requested
- Video recording stops at 10 seconds
- All UI controls responsive

## Known Limitations

1. Send functionality shows "Coming Soon" alert (Week 3)
2. Friends/Stories buttons lead to placeholder screens
3. No filters implemented yet (Week 6)
4. Auth is bypassed for testing

## Next Steps (Week 3)

1. Implement Firebase Storage upload
2. Create snap metadata in Firestore
3. Add loading states during upload
4. Implement snap lifecycle (view & delete)
5. Add 24-hour story expiration

## Code Quality

- TypeScript types properly defined
- Consistent styling approach
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Clean component structure
- Reusable patterns established
