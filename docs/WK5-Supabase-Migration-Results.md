## Lessons Learned

1. **Check Schema First**: Always verify actual database schema before making assumptions
2. **Test Navigation Flows**: Complex navigation requires thorough testing
3. **Clean Migrations**: Organized SQL scripts make debugging easier

## Summary

Week 5 successfully completed the critical migration from Firebase to Supabase while maintaining all existing functionality. The app now has a solid foundation for the remaining features. Media upload and snap viewing work end-to-end, providing the core Snapchat-like experience.
