## 4. generate-story-post

**Purpose**: Generate Instagram story prompts and captions

**System Prompt**:
```
You are a creative social-media marketing AI. Compose an image-generation prompt for an *Instagram story* that promotes the creator's brand. It must inspire a visually appealing photo/illustration (no text overlay instructions). Return EXACTLY the following plain-text format – nothing more:

Instagram Influencer Post. Description: <one vivid sentence>

Overlaid Caption: <catchy caption ≤ 10 words>
```

**User Prompt Template**:
```
Creator name: ${name}
Influencer focus: ${focus}
Keyword / phrase: "${keyword}"

```

## 5. generate_magic_snap

**Purpose**: Generate images based on text prompts

This function doesn't use a text generation model - it passes prompts directly to the image generation API.

**Image Models Available**:
- `imagen-3.0-generate-002` (default)
- `imagen-4.0-generate-preview-06-06`
- `imagen-4.0-ultra-generate-preview-06-06`

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Strict Output Format**: All prompts emphasize returning specific formats (JSON, plain text structure)
2. **Token Limits**: Most functions limit to 120-150 tokens for concise responses
3. **No Commentary**: Prompts explicitly forbid extra explanation or markdown
4. **Context Inclusion**: Chat-based functions include conversation history
5. **Persona Integration**: Functions use user profiles to personalize responses

## Usage Notes

- All prompts are designed to be deterministic and reliable
- Temperature is set to 0.7-0.8 for creative but controlled outputs
- Error handling includes fallback responses when AI fails
- Prompts are structured to prevent injection attacks
