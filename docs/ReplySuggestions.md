# âœ¨ Reply Suggestions â€“ "The Long Game"

## 1 â€” Purpose
Provide the user with three concise, context-aware reply options that align with
their conversational *strategy* (goal). Suggestions are delivered when the user
taps the âœ¨ icon next to the send button.

## 2 â€” Strategies (v0.1 hard-coded)
| Enum                             | Chat Behaviour (index 0 suggestion)              |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| STRATEGY_PROJECT_CONFIDENCE      | Confident, playful, leading                     |
| STRATEGY_ASSESS_COMPATIBILITY    | Deeper questions, seeks shared values           |
| STRATEGY_KEEP_CASUAL             | Light-hearted, logistical, no pressure          |

Index 1 is always Neutral / Flirty, index 2 is Practical / Low-effort.

## 3 â€” User Flow
1. User taps âœ¨ inside the input bar.
2. Bottom sheet appears:

   * After response, shows three buttons:
     ```

   * Tap outside / Cancel â†’ sheet closes and preserves any existing draft.

## 4 â€” Client â†’ Edge Function Payload
