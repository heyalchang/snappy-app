Here’s a high-level map of the repository after a first pass through the key entry points and folders.  (I focused on the runtime code you’re likely to iterate on first; docs and “Deprecated” material are noted but not inspected in depth.)

1. Runtime stack & entry points  
   • Expo / React-Native project – `app.json` drives the Expo config, `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.  
   • Top-level `App.tsx` simply re-exports `src/App.tsx` (standard Expo pattern).  
   • `src/App.tsx` → wraps the app in `SafeAreaProvider`, injects `Navigation`, and keeps an Expo `StatusBar`.

2. Navigation layer  
   • `src/Navigation.tsx` uses React-Navigation (native-stack).  
   • Auth flow (unauthenticated): `Auth` → `PhoneNumber` → `VerifyCode` → `Username`.  
   • Main app (authenticated) placeholders: `Camera`, `SnapPreview`, `Friends`, `Chat`, `Stories`.  
   • `RootStackParamList` is typed to ensure route params are correct.

3. Authentication / onboarding screens  
   • `AuthScreen.tsx` – simple landing with “Log In” & “Sign Up” buttons (both route to `PhoneNumber` for now).  
   • `PhoneNumberScreen.tsx` – collects a number, formats as E.164, calls `sendVerificationCode()`.  
   • `VerifyCodeScreen.tsx` – six-digit code entry UI, calls `verifyCode()`.  
   • `UsernameScreen.tsx` – collects username / display name, navigates to camera placeholder.

4. Firebase layer  
   • `src/services/firebase.ts` – initializes Firebase (`initializeApp`, `initializeAuth` with `AsyncStorage` persistence, Firestore, Storage).  
   • `src/services/auth.ts` – thin wrapper; currently *stubbed* for Expo (RecaptchaVerifier isn’t available RN).  
       – `sendVerificationCode` and `verifyCode` just log and resolve; they’re TODOs for production.  
       – Helper: `subscribeToAuthChanges` and `signOut`.  
   • `src/types/index.ts` – shape of `User`, `Snap`, `Message` entities.

5. Firebase-specific project config lives under `firebase-config/`  
   • Firestore rules & indexes, Storage rules, Cloud Functions scaffold (`functions/src/index.ts` etc.).  
   • Appears to be compiled JS already (`lib/`) suggesting TypeScript cloud functions.

6. Documentation & project planning  
   • `/docs` is populated with MD status reports, test results, product requirements, etc.  
   • There is older material under “Deprecated – don’t read/…”

7. Package & tooling  
   • Yarn / npm monorepo style (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`).  
   • React-Native dependencies plus Firebase JS SDK.  
   • ESLint / TS config present; no custom metro or babel plugins beyond default Expo.

Immediate observations / opportunities:  
• Auth is mocked; Recaptcha / Firebase phone auth still needs a proper Expo implementation (using `expo-firebase-recaptcha` or server-side verification).  
• Navigation toggles between auth vs. main app via a hard-coded `isAuthenticated` flag; hooking `subscribeToAuthChanges` there will give real auth state.  
• “Camera”, “Chat”, etc. are only placeholders; the data models in `types` give a sense of planned functionality (Snaps, messages, stories).  
• Firestore / Storage rules exist but should be audited once data layer is implemented.  
• The codebase is already TypeScript-first and well-typed; screens follow functional component + StyleSheet pattern.

I’m ready to dive deeper wherever you’d like—whether that’s wiring up the real phone-number auth flow, fleshing out camera/media features, or tightening backend rules and Cloud Functions.

“App entry not found” almost always means React Native never got as far as calling `AppRegistry.registerComponent("main", …)` – either the entry-file doesn’t exist, or something exploded while Metro was loading your JS bundle.  In this project the first case is unlikely (there is a root file), so let’s zero-in on the two real culprits I can see:

─────────────────────────
1. Entry-file discovery
─────────────────────────
• Expo’s `node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js` does  
  `import App from '../../App'`  
  and then registers it.  
• That import will be satisfied if a file named `App.js / .jsx / .ts / .tsx` sits in the project root **and simply exports a React component** (it should NOT call `registerRootComponent` itself).

Your repository looks like this:
  • `App.tsx`  – at root, OK  
  • but you *also* deleted the old `App.js` recently (git status shows it). That deletion is fine – Expo is perfectly happy with a `.tsx` file – **provided it compiles**.

─────────────────────────
2. Dependency / SDK mismatch (much more likely)
─────────────────────────
Expo SDK 53 expects:
  • react-native ≈ 0.73.*  
  • react          18.2.0  

Your `package.json` currently says:
  • `"react": "19.0.0"`  
  • `"react-native": "0.79.4"`  

Those versions are outside of Expo’s supported range and will cause Metro to throw during the very first require, which in turn bubbles up as  
`App entry point named "main" was not registered`  
on the device.

─────────────────────────
Fix it in three steps
─────────────────────────
1. Align the core peer-deps to what Expo 53 wants (the CLI will choose the exact patch versions):
   ```bash
   # ensure you’re in /Users/alchang/expodev
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json   # clean slate
   npm install              # restore baseline deps
   npx expo install react react-native
   ```

2. Clear every cache:
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c        # ‘-c’ = clear Metro, Babel & Expo caches
   ```

3. Run again in Expo Go (or your simulator).  
   If it still fails, open the Metro terminal tab – the **real** stack-trace appears there just before the “entry not found” message.  That line will point to the exact top-level exception (syntax error, duplicate module, etc.).

─────────────────────────
Optional safety nets
─────────────────────────
• If you prefer to keep a plain-JS wrapper so Expo always finds it, restore a minimal `App.js`:

```js
// App.js – thin wrapper, no registerRootComponent call
import App from './App.tsx';
export default App;
```

• Disable the New Architecture flag temporarily (rarely necessary but quick to test):
```jsonc
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    // …
    "newArchEnabled": false
  }
}
```

─────────────────────────
Checklist to confirm afterwards
─────────────────────────
□ `npx expo doctor` shows no peer-dependency errors.  
□ Metro console has **zero** red-box errors before the app registers.  
□ Opening the app in Expo Go no longer shows “App entry not found”.

Give that a try and let me know the first hint of an error Metro prints if it still refuses to load—once we see that stack-trace we can nail any remaining issue quickly.

Here’s what the `expo.log` shows and what it means:

```
Starting Metro Bundler
…
iOS Bundled 7194ms node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js (925 modules)
ERROR  [runtime not ready]: Error: Component auth has not been registered yet, js engine: hermes
```

1  Bundler finished without compile-time errors  
 • Metro built your JS bundle (925 modules) in ~7 s, so the code transpiled fine.  
 • The crash happens only when that bundle starts running on the device/simulator.

2  Runtime exception – “Component auth has not been registered yet”  
 • This message is raised when React Native tries to render a **lower-case** element (`<auth …/>`) that isn’t a built-in native view.  
 • It’s **not** about Firebase Auth; it’s React Native complaining that it can’t find a native view called `auth`.  
 • Most often this comes from:  
   a) A JSX element typed in lower-case by mistake (`<auth>` instead of `<Auth>`), **or**  
   b) A version mismatch that makes RN mis-resolve host components.

3  Why a version mismatch is the likeliest culprit here  
 • Your `package.json` pins `"react": "19.0.0"` and `"react-native": "0.79.4"`.  
 • Expo SDK 53 (which you’re using) **expects** React 18.2 and React Native 0.73.x.  
 • When the runtime versions don’t match what Expo’s native code was compiled for, React Native’s view registry can break in exactly this way – the first native component lookup fails and you get the “Component XYZ has not been registered” red-box.  
 • Because the error string is `auth`, the first failed lookup happened to be a (totally valid) prop called `auth` inside Expo’s own startup code; once the registry is corrupted, RN reports it as an unregistered native view.

What to do next
────────────────
1. Realign the core peer-dependencies to the versions Expo 53 requires:

```bash
# clean everything
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# reinstall baseline deps
npm install

# let Expo install matching versions
npx expo install react react-native
```

That will install:
 • react 18.2.x  
 • react-native 0.73.x  

2. Clear caches & restart:

```bash
npx expo start -c        # ‘-c’ clears Metro/Babel/Expo caches
```

3. If you still see the same red-box, search your codebase for a stray lower-case `<auth>` tag:

```bash
rg "<auth" --iglob '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}' --hidden
```

—but in most cases the version-mismatch fix above eliminates the error.

Extra sanity checks
───────────────────
• Run `npx expo doctor` – it should no longer warn about unsupported React / RN versions.  
• If you were experimenting with the New Architecture, temporarily set `"newArchEnabled": false` in `app.json` until everything runs.  

Once dependencies line up, the app should boot without the “Component auth” error.

Okay, we've made a bunch of progress, and I'm actually doing this with another developer, but right now we've run into a bug where the camera, when we hit the camera button to record a video, it brings up the recording indicator, but when you let go of the button, it doesn't actually take the video. It takes photos, fine, with a single hit, but not videos. Also, the developer might have made some other changes in order to try to revert to the legacy API, which we absolutely do not want to do. It looks like the camera API changed in 49, and we're in, I guess, the SDK version 53, and so we want to use the modern approach to the audio, camera, and video.

Analysis only – no additional code changes promised.

1. Mismatch with planned tech-stack  
   • The Technical Plan (Week 2) explicitly says “expo-camera basic setup (using new CameraView API)” and SDK 53 indeed expects the new module.  
   • `CameraScreen.tsx` in the repo is still importing `expo-camera/legacy`. That tells us the current build is running the *deprecated shim*, which is maintained only for backward-compat —​it won’t receive bug-fixes and already behaves differently from the modern API.

2. Why the video never materialises  
   • In the legacy layer `recordAsync()` resolves **only after** `stopRecording()` fires.  
   • The UI logic is:  
     – `onLongPress` ⇒ call `recordAsync()` and await its promise.  
     – `onPressOut` ⇒ call `stopRecording()`.  
   • If `onLongPress` and `onPressOut` triggers overlap too quickly, `recordAsync()` can race the internal start callback (especially on iOS 17 / RN 0.79). The camera may reject the start request with no thrown error, leaving `isRecording` stuck `true` and no file generated.  
   • Expo’s newer `CameraView` fixed that timing issue by introducing an explicit `mode="video"` prop and better native throttling; it also logs a warning if microphone permission is missing (legacy silently ignores audio and sometimes drops the recording).

3. Side-effects of trying to “revert”  
   • Someone added `/legacy` to the import path. That forces the old implementation even on SDK 53 and skips the modern fixes.  
   • Any other runtime tweaks (e.g. `useCamera2Api`, hand-written permission helpers) will be ineffective or throw in the modern stack, so retaining them keeps the code in an indeterminate state.

4. Permission coverage  
   • SDK 53 requires both CAMERA and MICROPHONE permissions for video. The existing component only asked for camera permission. On Android that still lets `recordAsync()` run but produces a silent 0-byte file; on iOS it often aborts recording immediately.

5. Conclusion / high-level path forward (not executed)  
   a. Remove the `/legacy` import and switch to `CameraView`.  
   b. Replace the permission code with `useCameraPermissions()` + `useMicrophonePermissions()`.  
   c. Pass `mode={isRecording ? 'video' : 'picture'}` to the component (or simply leave `mode="video"` if you always support video).  
   d. Keep the existing `recordAsync()` / `stopRecording()` flow – it works the same but with the race fixed.  
   e. Re-test on both platforms; the “no file produced” symptom should disappear.

That explains why photos succeed (they use `takePictureAsync()`, which isn’t affected) and videos fail only after the press-and-hold gesture.
