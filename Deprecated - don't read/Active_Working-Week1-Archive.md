# Active Working Document - Week 1 Archive

## Week 1 Goal: Foundation & Auth
Build the foundation of the Snappy app with TypeScript, navigation, and authentication screens.

### Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Class project, use defaults, basic error handling
- **Requirements Only**: Build ONLY what's in the PRD
- **MVP Focus**: Working > Perfect
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add packages when necessary

## Progress Tracker

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Project setup and Git initialization
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Folder structure creation
- [x] React Navigation setup
- [x] Firebase SDK installation
- [x] Auth screens implementation:
  - [x] Auth landing screen
  - [x] Phone number input screen
  - [x] Verification code screen
  - [x] Username creation screen
- [x] Mock authentication flow
- [x] Navigation flow between screens
- [x] Form validation and error handling
- [x] Loading states for async operations
- [x] Documentation (WK1 results, testing criteria)

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Real Firebase configuration
- [ ] Actual phone authentication implementation

### 📝 Notes
- Using Firebase Web SDK (not react-native-firebase)
- Mock auth returns success for any 6-digit code
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- All screens styled to match Snapchat aesthetic
- Navigation uses conditional rendering based on auth state

### 🐛 Issues Encountered
- react-native-firebase is deprecated, switched to web SDK
- TypeScript moduleResolution needed to be "bundler" for Expo

### 🎯 Next Week (Week 2)
- Set up real Firebase project
- Implement actual phone auth with reCAPTCHA
- Add Firestore user creation
- Start camera implementation
- Basic snap capture functionality
