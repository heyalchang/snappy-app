# SnapClone Technical Implementation Plan - MVP (V1.1)

## Version History
- **V1.0** - Original plan with Firebase Phone Auth
- **V1.1** - Simplified to username/password auth (no Firebase Auth SDK)

## Core Principles
- **Simplest path to MVP** - This is a class project, not commercial
- **Requirements only** - No extra features beyond PRD
- **Basic security only** - HTTPS and simple username/password is sufficient
- **Working > Perfect** - Focus on functionality over optimization
- **No Firebase Auth** - Use Firestore-based username/password instead

## Tech Stack
- **Expo SDK**: 53.0.12
- **React Native**: 0.79.4
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3
- **expo-camera**: 16.x (uses new CameraView API)
- **Firebase**: Web SDK 11.x (Firestore & Storage only, NO Auth SDK)
- **Authentication**: Simple username/password stored in Firestore

---

## Authentication Architecture Change (V1.1)

### Why the Change?
The original plan used Firebase Auth SDK with phone authentication. This caused "Component auth has not been registered yet" runtime errors due to React Native initialization timing issues. For a class project MVP, this complexity is unnecessary.

### New Simplified Approach
1. **No Firebase Auth SDK** - Remove completely to avoid initialization errors
2. **Username/Password in Firestore** - Store credentials directly (plaintext for MVP)
3. **Simple Login Flow**:
   - User enters username/password
   - Check against Firestore `users` collection
   - Store username in React Context
   - Use username as user ID throughout app

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// users collection schema
{
  username: string,      // unique, used as ID
  password: string,      // plaintext for MVP
  displayName?: string,
  friends: string[],     // array of usernames
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Benefits
- No Firebase Auth initialization errors
- Simpler codebase
- Easier to debug
- Still meets all PRD requirements (identity, friends, stories, etc.)

## Technical Decisions (Simplified)

### Stack
```
Frontend:
- Expo SDK (latest stable)
- TypeScript (basic config)
- React Navigation 6
- Context API only

Backend:
- Firebase Auth (phone)
- Firestore (basic rules)
- Firebase Storage
- Cloud Functions (minimal)

External:
- Replicate API (one filter)
```

### Project Structure
```
src/
  screens/        # One file per screen
  components/     # Shared UI components
  services/       # firebase.ts, media.ts
  utils/          # helpers.ts
  types/          # index.ts
  App.tsx
  Navigation.tsx
```

### Data Models
- User: `uid, username, displayName, phoneNumber, friends[]`
- Snap: `snapId, creatorId, mediaUrl, recipients, expiresAt, viewedBy[]`
- Message: `messageId, senderId, content, sentAt, readAt`

## What We're NOT Building
- CI/CD pipelines
- Multiple environments
- E2E encryption
- Screenshot detection
- Analytics tracking
- Error monitoring (beyond console.log)
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility features
- COPPA/GDPR compliance
- 99.9% uptime requirements

## Definition of Done (Class Project Version)

âœ… **Feature Complete**: All PRD requirements implemented  
âœ… **No Crashes**: App doesn't crash during normal use  
âœ… **Works on Simulator**: iOS and Android simulators both work  
âœ… **Demo Ready**: Can demonstrate all features in class

## Risk Mitigations (Simple)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Firebase quotas | Use sparingly during testing |
| Video too large | Limit to 10 seconds, compress |
| Replicate API fails | Show error, use basic filters |
| Time running out | Focus on core loop first |

---

## Notes

This is a simplified MVP for a class project. Security is basic (HTTPS + Firebase Auth), performance is not optimized, and we're only building exactly what's in the requirements document.
