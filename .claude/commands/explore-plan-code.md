## Your task

Help me tackle this complex task using the explore->plan->code framework:

**Task**: $ARGUMENTS

### PHASE 1: EXPLORE 🔍
First, I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to understand:
- Project structure and architecture
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Dependencies and frameworks in use
- Similar implementations or patterns to learn from
- Potential impact areas
- Document key findings

### PHASE 2: PLAN 📋
Next, I'll create a detailed implementation plan:
- Break down the task into specific, manageable steps
- Create a todo list using TodoWrite to track progress
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Consider edge cases and potential challenges
- Define success criteria and testing approach

### PHASE 3: CODE 💻
Finally, I'll implement the solution:
- Follow the plan systematically, updating todos as I progress
- Write clean, idiomatic code following project conventions
- Test each component as I build
- Run linters and type checkers to ensure quality
- Document any important decisions or trade-offs
